Think of it like this: your Dockerfile is the recipe, the Docker image is the cake, and Cloud Run is the baker that serves it. First, you need to build your Docker image and push it to Google Container Registry (GCR). We'll build it in the cloud shell directly to save you setup. Just paste your dockerfile in the root directory of the Cloud Shell terminal to keep the build command simple!",
