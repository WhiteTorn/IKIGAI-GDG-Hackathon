You need something that will protect your existing floors, absorb impact, and provide a stable surface. Think about rubber flooring rolls, interlocking rubber tiles, or even thick foam mats. Each has pros and cons regarding price, durability, and ease of installation. For example, rubber rolls are great for covering a large area, but can be difficult to maneuver and cut. Tiles are easier to install but might be more expensive. Foam mats are cheap and portable but less durable.",
